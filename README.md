## Supported JS runtimes

Our philosophy is to adhere to web standard APIs as much as possible. We aim for our SDKs to work in all browsers, React Native, Deno, Bun and Cloudflare edge environments.

If you encounter any issues running out SDKs in one of these environments, please [open an issue](https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-js-sdk/issues/new).

## Documentation

The documentation for the API can be found [here](https://docs.speechmatics.com/).

More examples on how to use the SDK can be found in the [examples](./examples) folder.

Our Portal is also a good source of information on how to use the API. You can find it [here](https://portal.speechmatics.com/). Check out `Upload` and `Realtime Demo` sections.
