The concatenation of these words is represented as a single entity with the concatenated written form present in the 'content' field. The entities contain a 'spoken_form' field, which can be used in place of the corresponding 'word' type results, in case a spoken form is preferred to a written form. They also contain a 'written_form', which can be used instead of the entity, if you want a breakdown of the words without spaces. They can still contain non-breaking spaces and other special whitespace characters, as they are considered part of the word for the formatting output. In case of a written_form, the individual word times are estimated and might not be accurate if the order of the words in the written form does not correspond to the order they were actually spoken (such as 'one hundred million dollars' and '$100 million').

              Controls how sensitive the algorithm is in terms of keeping similar speakers separate, as opposed to combining them into a single speaker.  Higher values will typically lead to more speakers, as the degree of difference between speakers in order to allow them to remain distinct will be lower.  A lower value for this parameter will conversely guide the algorithm towards being less sensitive in terms of retaining similar speakers, and as such may lead to fewer speakers overall.  The default is 0.5.

          as query parameters, and any combination of the job inputs
          and outputs can be included by listing them in `contents`.

          If `contents` is empty, the body of the request will be
          empty.

          If only one item is listed, it will be sent as the body of
          the request with `Content-Type` set to an appropriate value
          such as `application/octet-stream` or `application/json`.

          If multiple items are listed they will be sent as named file
          attachments using the multipart content type.

          If `contents` is not specified, the `transcript` item will
          be sent as a file attachment named `data_file`, for
          backwards compatibility.

          If the job was rejected or failed during processing, that
          will be indicated by the status, and any output items that
          are not available as a result will be omitted. The body
          formatting rules will still be followed as if all items were
          available.
