# Diarization (React)

This package provides a react hook for grouping transcribed data by diazation data (i.e. speaker-separated transcription).

### Usage

This package mainly serves as a common dependency for higher level Speechmatics packages, so it's unlikely you'll want to use it on its own. You can check out the `@speechmatics/flow-client-react` package to [see it in action](../flow-client-react/src/use-flow-transcript.ts).
