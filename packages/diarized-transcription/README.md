# Diarized transcriptions

This package contains utilities for grouping transcription text according to diarization data, i.e. grouping text chronologically based on the speaker.

### Usage

This package mainly serves as a common dependency for higher level Speechmatics packages, so it's unlikely you'll want to use it on its own. At the moment, it's mainly used by the package `@speechmatics/use-diarized-transcription` package, which provides a React wrapper.

Check out the [`/test`](/test) directory to see it used in isolation.
